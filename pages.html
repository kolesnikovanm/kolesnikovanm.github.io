                <p> He grew up…</p>
                <p> He successfully graduated from school and university.</p>
                <p> He has good work…</p>
                <p> He has a new family, a lot of friends and a girlfriend…</p>
                <p> But he has a dream to find his first family…</p>
                <p> A few years he was looking for a place, where he was lost, on Google Earth…</p>
                <p> How could he find her birth home?</p>
                <p> What happened to his brother and family?</p>
                <p> Has his dream come true?</p>
                <p> I would recommend reading this <a href="https://saroobrierley.com/book/">book</a>, because I was really amazed by his feelings and emotions.</p>
